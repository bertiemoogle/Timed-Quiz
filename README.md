I have a feeling I must have overcomplicated this because the amount of code seems a bit excessive for what it is I've actually been building. Despite spending every waking moment trying to make it work it was still incomplete at the time of submission. I will continue to work on it and will resubmit when it is complete. But of course there is now a new challenge to work on which will probably be just as time-consuming. 

It seemed the best course of action was to break this down into its constituent parts, so the first thing I did was to make the timer. This continues to be a problem because, so far at least, I've not been able to make it add a penalty of five seconds when an incorrect button is pushed. It seems this should be very simple, so is a cause of frustration.

Then came the most difficult part - putting the question and the answer buttons on the screen. I think I've learned a lot from the painstaking effort that went into this. Our course leader did demonstrate a method we could use for this, but I was very ill at the time and didn't take it in, so I am currently going over last week's lesson videos and taking copious notes. I'm fairly sure I have too much code for this part of the program, so will change things accordingly for the resubmit.

As of yet the Highscores page is incomplete. This is mainly because of my problems working with the timer. I need to capture the final time to use as the score, then put that score into localStorage to be retrieved and used in the Highscore table. Hopefully I will be able to work this out soon.
